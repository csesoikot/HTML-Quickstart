  <h2 style='font-family: "Trebuchet MS"; color:#00b050;'>Balancing Your Health with Vitamin D</h2>
  <p><u><strong>Balancing Your Health from Vitamin D Deficiency</strong></u></p>
  
  <p>Your body requires a certain amount of vitamins and minerals each day to remain balanced. While immediate results are often not seen with a lack of proper care, it leads to negative build up over time, creating illness and disease. An often overlooked area of care is with Vitamin D. A daily dose of this vitamin through the sunshine offers a balance in health and well – being. Without having exposure to the sun or taking this vitamin, you create a <strong>Vitamin D deficiency </strong>and potential dangers within your body.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Why Your Body Needs Vitamin D</strong></p>
  
  <p>The ability to balance your system with Vitamin D is essential for basic stability and functionality within your body. Without the substance, you will easily gain imbalances with your heart and circulatory system. Diabetes and heart disease are some of the most common results that take effect over time from <strong>Vitamin D deficiency.</strong> It is also possible to acquire cancer or multiple sclerosis without your body being nurtured from this particular vitamin.</p>
  
  
   <p><strong>Forms of Vitamin D to Support You</strong></p>
   
   <p>There are specific foods and proactive steps that you can take to avoid <strong> Vitamin D deficiency.</strong> The most common problem that occurs with not having enough of this vitamin is from <strong>lack of sun exposure.</strong> When you have enough sunshine, your body can soak up the rays, translating the sunlight into the vitamin that your body craves. With a <strong>lack of sunshine,</strong> you will not be able to receive enough of the vitamins that you need. You will also want to balance your diet with fish, eggs and milk, all which contain more vitamins to assist with the balance with your health.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Substituting for the Lack of Sun Exposure</strong></p>
  
  <p>It is easy to say that sunshine helps to build Vitamin D and to stop diseases later on. However, there are many areas around the globe that have a <strong>lack of sunshine,</strong> making it difficult to receive the proper amount of the vitamin.</p>
  
  <p>If you want to change the results, then you can look at alternatives to reduce imbalances. Using food, supplements and finding indoor options that allow you to substitute from the <strong>lack of sun exposure</strong> introduces you to reduced risk from not having the vitamin while allowing your body to maintain balance.</p>

  <p>Keep your vitamins and minerals close by while maintaining balance with your health. If you live in an area where there is a <strong>lack of sunshine,</strong> then you may not be receiving enough Vitamin D. Supplementing this vitamin and finding ways to become conscious about your health with this substance helps you to maintain your health over a longer period of time. To avoid <strong>Vitamin D deficiency,</strong> you will want to look at substitutes and ways to rebalance with the care that you need.</p>

  <h2 style='font-family: "Trebuchet MS"; color:#00b050;'>Balancing Your Health with Vitamin D</h2>
  <p><strong>Cheesecake & Vitamin D May Help Falling Seniors</strong></p>
  
  <p>Very few essential vitamins and minerals are produced naturally by the body, however vitamin D is one that we produce simply by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56061/">exposure to sunlight.</a> You can supplement your vitamin D intake by ingesting vitamin D infused dairy products or taking it in pill form or simply apply our vitamin D patch after your shower.</p>
  
  
  <p>Vitamin D is also called calciferol and is divided by scientists into two sections including vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. D2 is mostly manufactured by people using sunlight exposed mushrooms, and D3 occurs naturally through a person’s direct contact with <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356951/">UVB rays.</a></p>
  
  <p>The current recommendation by many healthcare providers is 1,000 IU of vitamin D every single day for young people. This vitamin is essential in preventing depression, regulating type 2 diabetes, immunity against influenza and various autoimmune diseases, and helps against fractures and the damages associated with falling. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150817161206.htm">One study</a> suggests that increased vitamin D intake in the elderly may help prevent some of the risks associated with falling, including detrimental breaks in arms, legs, and hips.</p>
  
   
   <p>This study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society looked at sixty-eight participants in a North Carolina Meals-On-Wheels program, and gave thirty-four of them 100,000 International Units of vitamin D, and the other half a placebo. The researchers instructed the participants to keep a diary of their falls. Those researchers found that over 50% of these participants had insufficient vitamin D levels and less than 25% had levels that could be considered ideal. Of the 34 participants that received vitamin D supplementation, only one out of 34 had a sufficient amount of vitamin D.</p>
  
  
  <p>Seniors who where given vitamin D supplements through the Meals on Wheels program reported amazingly half the falls as participants that did not receive vitamin D in the placebo group, according to the study published online Aug. 16 in the <em>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.</em></p>
  
  <p>Besides for regulating mental health, and supporting the immune system, vitamin D is also linked to calcium absorption, wherein insufficient amounts vitamin D in the body handicaps it, allowing it to only absorb 10 to 15 percent of dietary calcium. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56060/">Calcium</a> is a required mineral, which is associated with regulating metabolism and bone growth as well as sustained bone density. Calcium in conjunction with vitamin D will enhance the autoimmune system of the elderly as well as insulate them from the bone loss associated with aging.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10780863">Another study</a> looked at the risk factors associated in the elderly for loss of bone mass density or BMD. They found risk factors in women included estrogen reduction in the body, weight loss, and alcohol usage. In men they found smoking and thinness to be the most major risk factors of fractures and breaking in the fall. The best things that you can do for your health, if you’re over the age of 65, is to gain weight, quit smoking and drinking if you have either of those habits, and to make certain that you’re getting your daily recommended doses of vitamin D so you can absorb your calcium.</p>
  
  <p>Just think of that slice of cheesecake as being a supplement to your bone mass density, being rich in both calcium and vitamin D. Its high caloric value is beneficial to your weight gain regimen, which will ensure your bones maintain a healthy thickness to protect you from the damages of a potential fall.</p>
  
  <p>It is a delicious way to maintain your happiness and your health.</p>
  
  <p>Order your vitamin D patch <a href="http://innovativebalance.com/products/">here</a> and don’t forget to eat your cheesecake!</p>
  
  <p>Enjoy!</p>

  <h2 style='font-family: "Trebuchet MS"; color:#00b050;'>B12 Transdermal Patches are Superior & Easier to use than Daily Vitamin Pills</a></h2>
  <p><b>B-12 Transdermal Patches are Superior & Easier to use than Daily Pills, Sublinguals or Shots!</b><br/>

If you are like most people who suffer from low levels of vitamin B12 you either get your B12 from a prescribed shot, sublingualy administer drops under your tongue or taking daily vitamins that may not be absorbed properly through the digestive system.<br/>

A B12 patch is so easy to use, you just shower and before applying any cream or topical substance apply your B12 transdermal patch and forget about it.<br/>

Health professionals agree that transdermal patches are a superior delivery system ESPECIALLY for vitamin B12 because the vitamin is readily absorbed into the system and by-passes the digestive system where absorption problems may occur.<br/></p>
